# back-end-user-stories
Lets try to figure out the requirements for the backend by writing down some user stories.

A user storie is a short and simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability.

It is as simple as: `As a <type of user>, I want <goal/feature> so that <reason>`.

Examples:

As a Cultris II player I want a highscore system so that I can compare my skill with others.

As a website visitor I want to see what this Cultris II is all about so that I can decide whether I want to play it.

These stories are rather abstract but they might help us to get started.

I suggest that we collect the Stories in the issue tracker
